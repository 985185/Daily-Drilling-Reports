## Signature Events (Top 8 by remark length)

- **2008-12-21 09:15–14:00** | **EQUIPMENT_FAILURE** — Sat seal assembly according to vetco procedure. Landing string dropped 8 1/4". Performed line test of surface line against fail safe valve to 345 bar / 10 min. Ok. Closed lower pipe ram and lined up TDS to trip tank to monitor for returns. Pressured up in stages to 207 bar below closed ram. Bled off pressure to zero. Pumped 350 ltrs and got 300 ltrs back. Opened rams and took 45 MT overpull. Closed ram and pressure tested seal assembly 35/345 bar for 5/10 min. Dropped 3.5 bar (1 %) / 15 min. 550 ltrs pumped and 450 ltrs bled back. Reduced overpull to 3 MT. Rotated 4 right-hand turns and released.
- **2008-12-21 06:00–07:30** | **CASING** — Displaced cmt to rig floor with 500 ltrs of DW at 1000 lpm. Released top dart and pumped 1500 ltrs at 1500 lpm behind cmt using cmt unit. Top wiper plug sheared at 158 bar after 750 ltrs pumped.

Lined up through to top drive and zeroed stroke counters on mud pumps. Continued dispacing cmt by pumping OBM at 3000 lpm.  Sheared btm plug at 7219 strks (159.8 m3) / 155 bar. Reduced rate to 1200 lpm at 8400 strks (185.7 m3). FCP was 53 bar. Bumped top plug at 8552 stks (189.0 m3) / 142 bar.
- **2008-12-21 07:30–09:15** | **CASING** — Pressured up surface lines to 140 bar to equalize and open lo-torque on cmt head. Attempted to close IBOP. No go. Bled off pressure to 95 bar, closed IBOP and continued to pressure up csg to 345 bar. Bled off standpipe pressure to 25.7 bar and monitored for leak through IBOP. Performed pressure test of 13 3/8" csg to 345 bar / 15 min, Ok. Bled back pressure to 20 bar and monitored for back flow. No back flow observed. 2.9 m3 pumped and 2.9 m3 bled back.
- **2008-12-21 04:15–06:00** | **CASING** — Performed line test of cmt hose to 345 bar/10 min. Ok. Pumped 8 m3 of base oil at 1760 lpm followed by 20 m3 1.67 sg tuned spacer E at 1760 lpm using rig pumps. Chased spacer to drill floor with 3 m3 OBM. 

Lined up to pump from cmt unit. Opened lo-torque valve with 20 bar on cmt line to verify line-up. Released btm dart for btm plug. Mixed and pumped 23.25 m3 1.90 sg silica cmt slurry at 800 lpm / 32 bar and 7.0 m3 g-cmt slurry at 800 lpm/ 20 bar.
- **2008-12-16 22:30–00:00** | **CEMENTING** — Installed casing tong on IR tracks. Made up DP x-over to 13 3/8" casing swadge. 

Meanwhile lined up cement unit to pump down F-14 injection annulus. Stepped up pressure from 126 bar to 138 bar when sudden leak off to 60 bar was observed. Continued injection and stepped up pump rate to 1000 lpm / CUP 71 bar. Injected 150 m3 seawater at 1000-1200 lpm. After shut in the pressure stabilized at 50 bar after 1 hour (still 50 bar at 07:00).
- **2008-12-16 07:30–09:15** | **TRIP** — Made up TDS to drillstring in order to work through restriction from 1385 m MD. Broke circulation and staged up pumps to 3000 lpm /  SPP 111 bar. Rotated at 15-50 rpm and worked area from 1385 m to 1357 m MD. Observed torque peaks of 20 kNm at 1370 and 1381 m MD. Stopped rotation and circulation and pulled from 1385 m to 1357 m MD with no overpull. No overpull detected at shoedepth 1368 m MD.
