## Operational Timeline (Reconstructed from Daily Drilling Reports)

| Date | Depth (MD) | Primary Operation | Issue / Observation | Decision / Action | Operational Outcome |
|------|------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 25-May-2013 | ~3754 m → uphole | Pumped P&A cement plug. Waited on cement (WOC). Performed BOP test. | No abnormal flow observed during flow checks. | Circulated and conditioned mud. Reduced mud weight from 1.32 sg to 1.28 sg. | Cement plug placed. Well stable. Prepared for kick-off and BHA transition. |
| 26-May-2013 | TOC tagged at 3389 m | Spotted Hi-Vis pill. Pumped 2.00 sg cement kick-off plug. | No backflow observed. Well static during checks. | Displaced cement. Pulled out cement stinger. Began make-up of 12¼" drilling BHA. | Kick-off plug integrity confirmed. Transition to drilling phase initiated. |
| 27-May-2013 | Surface → 2494 m | RIH with 12¼" drilling BHA. | Recurrent hydraulic leaks on Top Drive System (TDS). | Replaced alignment cylinder. Repaired TDS oil cooler. Conducted choke drill. | Mechanical downtime managed. Successfully RIH to 2494 m. Ready to drill cement and kick off. |

## Key Engineering Observations

1. Cement plug integrity was verified via:
   - Tagging TOC at 3389 m
   - No backflow during flow checks
   - Stable well conditions during WOC

2. Mud weight reduction from 1.32 sg to 1.28 sg indicates transition from plug placement to drilling phase.

3. Rig mechanical reliability (Top Drive hydraulic system) directly impacted operational timeline.

4. BOP and choke drill testing confirm barrier integrity prior to drilling out cement.

## Interpretation

This sequence represents the controlled transition from plug placement to sidetrack/kick-off operations in a HPHT well environment.

The Daily Drilling Reports demonstrate:

- Barrier verification (cement plug + BOP test)
- Well stability confirmation
- Managed mechanical interruption
- Controlled progression toward 12¼" section drilling

## Why This Matters for Legacy Well Reconstruction

This 3-day window captures:

- Cement plug depth and density
- TOC verification
- Mud weight strategy
- Mechanical downtime affecting operational schedule
- Barrier testing procedures

Such information is not available in log datasets alone and is critical for long-term well integrity assessment and decommissioning analysis.
