- **12:15–12:45** | **TRIP** | drilling -- drill — Flowchecked prior to POOH with BHA - well static. Meanwhile re-arranged equipment on drillfloor for racking 17 1/2" drilling BHA due to winds exceeding set limits for crane. Held t...
- **12:45–13:30** | **DRILLING** | drilling -- drill — Removed PS-30 slips from rotary. Installed masterbushing and bowl. Re-arranged equipment on drillfoor as required for racking BHA.
- **13:30–16:00** | **TRIP** | drilling -- trip — POOH with 17 1/2" dirlling BHA. Broke and racked back 5 1/2" HWDP, DC/accellerator, DC/jar, NMDC/DC and ARC/powerpulse/powerdrive. Gauged and graded bit.

- **16:15–18:00** | **CASING** | drilling -- casing — Picked up jet sub. Picked up and made up WBRRT. RIH on 5 1/2" DP from surface to 140 m MD. Jetted BOP on way in at 3400 lpm / SPP 22 bar.
- **18:00–18:30** | **CASING** | drilling -- casing — Jettted across wellhead at 1800 lpm / SPP 18 bar. Pulled nominal seat protector in wellhead.
- **18:30–20:15** | **CASING** | drilling -- casing — POOH with WBRRT on 5 1/2" DP from 140 m MD to surface. Released NSP from WBRRT. Broke and laid out WBRRT and jet sub.
- **20:15–20:45** | **CASING** | drilling -- casing — Cleared and tidied drillfloor. Inspected aft PRS rollers and dies prior to casing running.
- **20:45–21:00** | **CASING** | drilling -- casing — Held toolbox talk for rigging casing running equipment.
- **21:00–22:30** | **CASING** | drilling -- casing — Changed elevator on TDS. Installed FJE in aft PRS.
- **22:30–00:00** | **CEMENTING** | drilling -- casing — Installed casing tong on IR tracks. Made up DP x-over to 13 3/8" casing swadge. 

Meanwhile lined up cement unit to pump down F-14 injection annulus. Stepped up pressure from 126 b...

## Key Remarks (Top 5 by length)

- **22:30–00:00** | **CEMENTING**: Installed casing tong on IR tracks. Made up DP x-over to 13 3/8" casing swadge. 

Meanwhile lined up cement unit to pump down F-14 injection annulus. Stepped up pressure from 126 bar to 138 bar when sudden leak off to 60 bar was observed. Continued injection and stepped up pump rate to 1000 lpm / CUP 71 bar. Injected 150 m3 seawater at 1000-1200 lpm. After shut in the pressure stabilized at 50 bar after 1 hour (still 50 bar at 07:00).
- **07:30–09:15** | **TRIP**: Made up TDS to drillstring in order to work through restriction from 1385 m MD. Broke circulation and staged up pumps to 3000 lpm /  SPP 111 bar. Rotated at 15-50 rpm and worked area from 1385 m to 1357 m MD. Observed torque peaks of 20 kNm at 1370 and 1381 m MD. Stopped rotation and circulation and pulled from 1385 m to 1357 m MD with no overpull. No overpull detected at shoedepth 1368 m MD.
- **00:00–01:30** | **DRILLING**: Discussed situation. Decided to attempt sweeping hole and place LCM pill across the Grid formation. Mixed and weighed 1,43 sg / 167 kg/m3 Calcarb/Steelseal LCM pill. Meanwhile circulated in well at 4500 lpm / SPP 277 bar.
- **12:15–12:45** | **TRIP**: Flowchecked prior to POOH with BHA - well static. Meanwhile re-arranged equipment on drillfloor for racking 17 1/2" drilling BHA due to winds exceeding set limits for crane. Held toobox talk for racking back BHA.
- **09:15–10:30** | **CASING**: Flow checked well at casing shoe. Observed static losses of 130 /l/hrs. Removed skirt on TDS torque wrench and took measurements for Tesco equipment as required.
