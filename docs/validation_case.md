# Validation Case Study

## Selected Well

The initial validation case for Subsurface Data Lab is **Volve Well F-1**.

This well is used as a controlled test case to demonstrate that legacy operational records can be converted into structured well history.

## Purpose of the Validation

The goal of the validation is not full automation accuracy, but reproducibility.

The workflow must demonstrate that:

- operational events can be identified
- a chronological drilling history can be reconstructed
- the well construction sequence can be understood without manual report reading

## What will be reconstructed

The following information will be reconstructed from drilling reports:

- drilling sections
- casing runs
- cementing operations
- logging operations
- testing operations
- operational problems (losses, kicks, NPT)

## Success Criteria

The workflow is considered successful if an engineer unfamiliar with the original drilling reports can understand the well construction sequence using only the generated timeline.

## Why this matters

Manual interpretation of drilling reports is time-consuming and inconsistent.

A reproducible reconstruction workflow allows wells to be reviewed for abandonment and CO₂ storage assessment without re-reading large volumes of documentation.
